**Hangman** is a classic word-guessing game developed in Python. The player has to guess the hidden word one letter at a time, with a limited number of incorrect guesses allowed before the game ends.

This project includes:

* Random word selection from a predefined list
* Hint system to assist the player
* Difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard)
* Visual representation of the hangman with each wrong guess
* User-friendly and interactive text-based interface

This game is a great way to practice Python fundamentals like loops, conditionals, string handling.
